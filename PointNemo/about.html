                <span class="about-text-block-title">What is Array?</span>
                <p>Array is an online platform which provides content with the goal of entertaining people. 
                    We have 3 categories: Games, Music, Quizzes; but we aim to expand to other places as we grow and learn. 
                    On Array you can browse as a guest, or create your own account and customise your own unique profile, 
                    allowing you to message and play with friends, 
                    have your quiz and game stats tracked and optionally displayed to other players, 
                    allowing them to have a score to beat. 
                    We also have our own Music platform powered by Spotify for Developers' powerful, open-source Web API. 
                    The music platform contains custom playlists curated by us, as well as a series of lists and suggestions. 
                    If you don't like what we suggest, 
                    you can log into your Spotify account and play your favourite songs while browsing.</p>

                <span class="about-text-block-title">The people behind Array</span>
                <p>Array is a passion project by two students, our names are Jayden and Aiden. 
                    We have a newfound passion for web development, specifically front-end web development. 
                    However, we are intrigued by all aspects of it and are eager to carry on learning both ends of the spectrum. 
                    Jayden has an affinity for HTML and CSS, and is learning JavaScript. 
                    Aiden has an affinity for JavaScript and is learning HTML and CSS. 
                    So we partner well, and teach each other new things as we work together. 
                    We started learning web development in January 2023, but we didn't really focus on it and properly take keen interest until September 2023. 
                    Please understand that we still have a long way to go on our journey so there will be some bugs and issues. 
                    Please feel free to inform us of these via our social media accounts.</p>

                        Array is active on 3 social media sites, 
                        however we are open to expanding to more based upon user feedback. 
                        Those 2 platforms are X (FKA. Twitter), Instagram, and Facebook. 
                        We encourage users to follow us on these platforms to stay up to 
                        date with the development of new features, bug fixes, and our own content. 
                        Also, please use our social platforms to inform us of any bugs and issues as 
                        it will allow us to put out a fix as soon as possible. As well as this, you can also follow our
